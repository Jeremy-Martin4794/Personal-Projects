# Personal-Projects
This is a collection of a few personal programming projects of mine. 
Keep in mind that some of these projects are **not** complete yet.
Given the many files associated with the Unity game, only the scipts are included in the repository.
The main projects in this repository include:
* A 2D Chess game
* A 2D Unity platformer game
* A website that gives info about HTML, JS, and CSS
